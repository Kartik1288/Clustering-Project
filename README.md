# Customer Segmentation Using K Means Clustering
This project aims to segment customers of a supermarket mall based on their purchasing habits using K-means clustering algorithm in Python. By clustering customers based on their similarities, the supermarket can better understand their target customers and plan marketing strategies accordingly.

# Data Preparation
The first step in the project is data preparation, which involves the following steps:

1. Missing values treatment: The missing values in the data set are identified and treated by either dropping or imputing the missing values.

2. Data transformation: The data is transformed by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables.

3. Outlier treatment: The outliers in the data set are identified and treated using various methods.

4. Data standardisation: The data is standardised to ensure that all variables are on the same scale.

# K-means Algorithm Implementation
After data preparation, the K-means algorithm is implemented to cluster the customers based on their purchasing habits. The steps involved in K-means algorithm implementation are as follows:

1. Finding the optimal value of K: The optimal number of clusters is determined by running the K-means algorithm multiple times with different values of K and evaluating the results using various metrics.

2. Implementing the K-means algorithm: The K-means algorithm is implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python.

3. Analysing the clusters: The clusters obtained from the K-means algorithm are analysed to gain business insights, such as identifying the characteristics of customers in each cluster, determining appropriate product pricing, developing customised marketing campaigns, designing an optimal distribution strategy, choosing specific product features for deployment, and prioritising new product development efforts.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation in a supermarket mall. By analysing the clusters of customers, the supermarket can better understand their target customers and develop strategies to meet their needs.
